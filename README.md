## Architecture
The repository contains the code files and Jupyter Notebooks for cross validation, along with a folder _Results_. 
You should first of all unzip the model weights files 

## Installation
We strongly advise you to run our program on Google Colab framework to speed the runtime. 

### Packages
We use keras to build our neural networks model, along with the binary focal loss. 
The following lines should be run at the beginning of the colab notebook.  
```
$ !pip install focal-loss
$ !pip install plot_keras_history
```
